speak;And that's when I began to respect the little man;And I think Vance was three right about then;He started school and one day he came home and at the doorway;I could tell the little man didn't want to come inside;He'd met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty;Had caught him walkin' home with her and nearly killed Vance;But then Vance never cried and the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride;And he said papa do you become a man when you're twenty one;And I said age doesn't make a man a man my son;He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind;And I think Vance was seven about that time;;I guess they say that first love is the very best;At least it was with Vance 'cause he'd scratched Becky on his desk;But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small;And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall;And then a few years later Vance came in one day;And told me and his mama that he had to go away;To be fitted for a uniform and though his mama shed a tear;He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years;And he looked at me and said papa I'm gonna be a man;Well two years to the day Vance came walkin' in the driveway;And I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near;He came in and he hugged his mama;And said hey papa little man wanna go with me somewhere and grab a beer;So we're sittin' at this table when this fella at the bar started buggin' Vance;Callin' him soldier but Vance kept his cool;And he said papa that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now;Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school;Then Smitty said the wrong thing when he brought up Becky's name;And Vance finally stood and said boy what did you say;And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty;And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away;Well

didn't want him to know her;She had a grandson, 2 years old, that I never even showed her;;I'm living in shame;Mama, I miss you;I know you're not to blame;Mama, I miss you;;Came a telegram;Mama passed away while making homemade jam;Before she died, she cried to see me by her side;She always did her best;Ah, cooking, cleaning, always in the same old dress;Working hard down on her knees, always

the dark;One slice is concern for all your dreams prayed;They won't come true and break your heart;Another slice is feedin' kids and wipin' noses;Cryin' when the doorbell rings and there are roses;Every woman knows a lot of give and take;Comes with the wedding cake;;It's facin' shadows of the future;Prayin' they will fall away as we walk toward them;Searchin' for the sun;And it's long and anxious hours with the wolf at the door;Hugs and kisses when, at last, we see the dawn;So when the hands of time trace tellin' lines upon our face;And lace our hair with strands of gray;We laugh and say for all who will partake;It all comes with the wedding cake;;Yes, for all who will partake;It all comes with the wedding cake;Yes, for all who will partake;It all comes with the wedding cake"},

didn't love;;Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for my head;And the kids are wild about the brand new car;You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry;If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare;No wonder in our prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through;The years of raisin' kids and payin' bills;And I think he guided us not because we were

had no words to say;My experience was limited and underfed;You were talking while I hid;To the one who was the father of your kid;You probably didn't think I did, but I heard;You say that love is just a four-letter word;;I said goodbye unnoticed;Pushed forth into my own games;Drifting in and out of lifetimes;Unmentionable by name;Searching for my double, looking for;Complete evaporation to the core;Though I tried and failed at finding any door;I must have thought that there was nothing more;Absurd than that love is just a four-letter word;;Though I never knew just what you meant;When you were speaking to your man;I can only think in terms of me;And now I understand;After waking enough times to think I see;The Holy Kiss that's supposed to last eternity;Blow up in smoke, it's destiny;Falls on strangers, travels free;Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me;And I do not really need to be;Assured that love is just a four-letter word;;Strange it is to be beside you, many years the tables turned;You'd probably not believe me if told you all I've learned;And it is very, very weird indeed;To hear words like \"forever\" plead;Though ships run through my mind I cannot

know you;;In my life, there's an empty slot;Lord, I believe You can fill that spot;I just got to get to know you;I just got to get to know you;;Blessed are the days I spend with you;Realizing precious moment we never knew;But right now, I'm just imagining this thing;Would you believe the joy you bring, woah;;I just got to get to know you;I just got to get to know you;I wanna kiss your lips"},
